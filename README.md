# Hi there :wave:

This is a simple study repository to understand some metrics about form validations and something about good practices of input verifications.

In this study, we used these dependencies for the form validation:

* Express-sessions: It's to create sessions.
* Express-flash: We use this library to send data into a session, like error messages.
* Cookie-parser: We need this to parse the data for the cookie on user's browser.

In the future, i plan to analyse the **validator.js** dependency too, for apply in this study.
